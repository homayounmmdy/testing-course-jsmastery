## Programming paradigms

- Procedural
- Functional
- Object-oriented
- Event-driven
- Logic
- Aspect-oriented

Some language support one paradigms some other like
- Python
- Ruby
- Java
- JavaScript

support multiply.Aspect

in object-oriented programming everything is based on the concepts of the object.
object are unites that contain data which is call **State**.
and operations or methods are called **behaviour**.

in object-oriented we put Data and Behaviour inside Object
but in Functional we keep them separate the Data and Behaviour.

## Problem Solving

Process of **defining a problem**, identifying and comparing
**different solutions**, and picking the one that best solves
that problem with respect to the **context** and **constraints**.

## Benefits of OPP

- Reduced Complexity
- Easier Maintenance
- Code Reuse
- Faster Development

## Classes and Object

- **Class:** A blueprint or template for creating objects
for example we have class called Car
we have Fields like
- started
- currentSpeed
- currentGear
also it have some behaviour or methods like
- start()
- stop()
- brake()
- changeGear()

based on this you can create multiply car like car1,car2,car3

- **Object:** An instance of class

## Creating Class
we can create another by creating new file like this
```java
public class TextBox {
    public String text; // Field

    public void setText(String text) {
        this.text = text;
    }

    public void clear() {
        text = "";
    }
}

```

## Creating Objects
we have **var** when we add it the type is read for the value ;
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var textBox = new TextBox();
    }
}
```
here example of creating object using class
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var textBox1 = new TextBox();
        textBox1.setText("Box 1");
        System.out.println(textBox1.text.toUpperCase());

        var textBox2 = new TextBox();
        textBox2.setText("Box 2");
        System.out.println(textBox2.text);
    }
}
```
