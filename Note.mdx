# The Complete Next JS Testing Course

## What is the testing ?

Testing is how you make sure your code actually works.

it's safety net between you and production code.

by testing you make sure every feature works by your expected.

by well testing allow you to

- refactor don't break anything it will let you to refactor with confidence
- app become stable as it grow
- Catch bugs early
- Document behavior
- Deliver better UX

> You write code that test your code you do not check eg button manually

> Testing let you move fast without breaking things

## Different types of test

- Testing by Scope
  - Unit tests
  - Components tests
  - Integration tests
  - End-to-end tests
- Testing by Knowledge
  - Black box testing (testing by user perspective)
  - White box testing (testing under hood logic)
  - Gray box testing (balance between both perspective)
- Testing by Purpose
  - Functional testing
  - Non-Functional testing
- Testing by Execution
  - Manual testing
  - Automated testing

## Scope

It's about how much your system are you testing at once

## Unite Testing

it's like looking through the microscope you see the smallest testable part of application and
in Completely isolation. because you testing one piece without connection to anything else it's super fast

because this isolation it makes fast but also you have you muck several things because it's isolate.

it's best for

- Business logic
- Algorithms
- Data transformations
- any code that get input and produce predicted output

but they are less useful for testing:

- User interfaces
- Network communication
- Complex workflow

## Component Testing

a component is self contain pice of UI that combine

- logic
- presentation
- behavior

testing component is different from pure function

a component

- receive props
- manage state
- respond to user interactions
- render visual elements

## Integration Testing 

the integration test is like how organize of body are works together. your testing the 
- connection 
- the hand shakes 
- the data flow between parts of applications 

some time you test two connection like user with database sometimes is chain of connections
