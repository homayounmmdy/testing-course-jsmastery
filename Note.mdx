# The Complete Next JS Testing Course

## What is the testing ?

Testing is how you make sure your code actually works.

it's safety net between you and production code.

by testing you make sure every feature works by your expected.

by well testing allow you to

- refactor don't break anything it will let you to refactor with confidence
- app become stable as it grow
- Catch bugs early
- Document behavior
- Deliver better UX

> You write code that test your code you do not check eg button manually

> Testing let you move fast without breaking things

## Different types of test

- Testing by Scope
  - Unit tests
  - Components tests
  - Integration tests
  - End-to-end tests
- Testing by Knowledge
  - Black box testing (testing by user perspective)
  - White box testing (testing under hood logic)
  - Gray box testing (balance between both perspective)
- Testing by Purpose
  - Functional testing
  - Non-Functional testing
- Testing by Execution
  - Manual testing
  - Automated testing

## Scope

It's about how much your system are you testing at once

## Unite Testing

it's like looking through the microscope you see the smallest testable part of application and
in Completely isolation. because you testing one piece without connection to anything else it's super fast

because this isolation it makes fast but also you have you muck several things because it's isolate.

it's best for

- Business logic
- Algorithms
- Data transformations
- any code that get input and produce predicted output

but they are less useful for testing:

- User interfaces
- Network communication
- Complex workflow

## Component Testing

a component is self contain pice of UI that combine

- logic
- presentation
- behavior

testing component is different from pure function

a component

- receive props
- manage state
- respond to user interactions
- render visual elements

## Integration Testing 

the integration test is like how organize of body are works together. your testing the 
- connection 
- the hand shakes 
- the data flow between parts of applications 

some time you test two connection like user with database sometimes is chain of connections

## End to End Testing 

it's mot comprehensive and realistic but also the most complex and expensive
when you run end to end you running real user journey for entire application using actual data.

It is same as real world. these test are slow because it's use :

- real browser automation
- network requests
- database operation
- external service call 

## Testing Knowledge

it's about how much you know about the internal working of the system.
it's not only help about what test to write it's also help to predicted how bugs 
you could catch.

## Black Box Testing 

is about being customer using production without knowing about how it's made they only care that 
it do what is suppose to do. it's only focus on input and output. like clicking add add to card that incess the 
list of items.

It is valuable for 
- Long-term maintenance 
- Tracking the system

when testing without understanding code you find 
- Confusing error messages 
- Unexpected behavior
- Missing features

but you can't test console error , or putting code in input and stuff like that 

## White Box Testing 

now you have full Knowledge on 

- Internal structure
- Logic 
- Implementation of code 

it's like engineer check that thing that they build. this test do 
- Exercise specific code paths 
- Test particular algorithms 
- Verify that internal logic 

you check what happen if user do something wrong or checking the edge cases.
because you know the logic you can write test that 
- Hit every branch 
- Test every condition 
- Verify that each piece of code works as intended

it's valuable for testing 
- Algorithms 
- Data structures
- complex business logic

the challenge is that can tidy with Implementation because you test 

- Internal methods 
- Private functions 
- Specific code paths 

by refactoring you might just break some places even the external behavior be the same

it's mostly used for 

- Mathematical calculations 
- Data processing algorithms
- Security functions  
- Core business logic 

the things that often change 

## Gray Box Testing

when you have some Knowledge of internal and external. you know what tool do you use 
but still do not mainly focus on logic you check by user perspective while check that work same 
as expected. by this you can 

- Test the riskiest areas
- Use realistic test data
- Cover edge code paths
