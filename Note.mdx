## Programming paradigms

- Procedural
- Functional
- Object-oriented
- Event-driven
- Logic
- Aspect-oriented

Some language support one paradigms some other like
- Python
- Ruby
- Java
- JavaScript

support multiply.Aspect

in object-oriented programming everything is based on the concepts of the object.
object are unites that contain data which is call **State**.
and operations or methods are called **behaviour**.

in object-oriented we put Data and Behaviour inside Object
but in Functional we keep them separate the Data and Behaviour.

## Problem Solving

Process of **defining a problem**, identifying and comparing
**different solutions**, and picking the one that best solves
that problem with respect to the **context** and **constraints**.

## Benefits of OPP

- Reduced Complexity
- Easier Maintenance
- Code Reuse
- Faster Development

## Classes and Object

- **Class:** A blueprint or template for creating objects
for example we have class called Car
we have Fields like
- started
- currentSpeed
- currentGear
also it have some behaviour or methods like
- start()
- stop()
- brake()
- changeGear()

based on this you can create multiply car like car1,car2,car3

- **Object:** An instance of class
